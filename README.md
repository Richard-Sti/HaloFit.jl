# HaloFit.jl

This repository offers a suite of utilities designed for analyzing dark matter halo properties within a periodic box. Typically, the functions expect input data in the form of arrays detailing particle positions, velocities, and masses. However, if particles have a uniform mass, instead of an array, you can provide a single mass value.

## Functions
- `periodic_distance`
- `center_of_mass`
- `shrinking_sphere_cm`
- `angular_momentum`
- `spherical_overdensity_mass`
- `lambda_bullock`
